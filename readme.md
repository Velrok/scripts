# description
This is a collection of scripts that may be usefull to somebody. They are usefull to me :) .

## usage
Most of the scripts are basic command line scripts. Put them inside a directory that is in your $PATH.  
For individual usage take a look into the script or try adding the --help argument to it.


### apple scripts
I exported them as programs, because this way one only has to double klick them to activate. But you can always change them using the AppleScript-Editor.
